# Dynamic 2D Environment Generator

This is a 2D environment generator useful for random generation of random layouts in 2D.
The implementation has been inspired by the environment description as specified in 
[Appendix G of RoCUS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13615.pdf).


### Environment Description

The environment is the area defined in the domain of (xmin, xmax) Ã— (ymin, ymax) along with
starting point (xstart, ystart) and ending point (xgoal, ygoal). The environment representation is a
summation of radial basis function (RBF) kernels centered "obstacle points" that are randomly generated 
based on a seed value. Specifically, given n obstacle points $p_{1}, p{2}, ..., p{n} âˆˆ R^2$,
the environment is defined at each point in the domain R^2 (within limits) as:

$$e(P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \exp(-\gamma || P - P_{i} ||_{2}^2)$$

A point P in the limits of the environment (xmin, xmax) Ã— (ymin, ymax) is an obstacle if $e(P) > \eta$.
